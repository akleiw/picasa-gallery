## May 2018, Mekong and Luang Prabang

We went to Laos from Chiang Rai (Thailand), opting for the famous "slow boat" that takes you from Huay Xai
just across the border with Thailand downstream the Mekong river to Luang Prabang, the historical capital
of Laos.

We didn't have many expectations, but Laos turned out to be more genuine and interesting than touristy Thailand.
The slow boat trip was amazing and very enjoyable, despite what some people say. We really enjoyed
sitting, drining beers, chatting, singing and playing guitars with local musicians, all along beautiful hilly and rocky scenery
along the river. The boat made frequent short stops, so we could see some local people and their living.
Both days on the boat weren't overly long either - we arrived to our destination at about 4pm both days,
still during daylight.

Getting to the slow boat from Chiang Rai is easy on your own - no packaged tours necessary. We took the first
6am cheap local bus from Chiang Rai to Chiang Khong (reservation not possible, but arrive 15-20 min earlier and
you will be fine), paid the driver an extra to get dropped by the border, exited Thailand, then
took a mandatory bus to the Laos side over the bridge, received visas on arrival pretty quickly ($35 for most passports).
People selling slow boat tickets were already waiting while you were filling visa form. Don't use their
services - they will tell you that you need to go with them to be on time, but they brought us to
their office to buy overpriced food and drink instead and wasted some time there. The actual boat
departs between 11-12am and you have plenty of time to get there with any tuk-tuk for much cheaper,
have time to buy food and drinks by the pier and tickets at the official ticket office.

The boat stops several km before Luang Prabang and you are forced to take a rather expensive tuk-tuk
to the city again. But locals do that too, unlike it was in the past.

Luang Prabang itself is a charming town, with plenty to see, eat and drink. Highly recommended to spend 
some time there. We also went to Kuang Si waterfall by a tuk-tuk, it's quite far, but totally worth it.
And after, the same tuk-tuk took us to the Pak Ou village across the Pak Ou cave temple. You can actually
see the temple some 30 min before final stop from the slow boat. The village itself gives you
a nice impression how people actually live in Laos and they offer inexpensive boat service to the
cave temple, which is really impressive as well.

Overall, Laos tends to be least visited country in South-East Asia, and that is a good thing.
Definitely go there before it gets too spoiled by mass tourism.
