# Dia de Muertos
## 28 October 2017

For quite some time I wanted to visit Mexico during the famous Day of the Dead.

Although it is a very old tradition, comprising ubiquitous altars and grave decorations,
James Bond Spectre movie inspired CDMX (Mexico City) government to also organize an annual
parade (Desfile de Muertos). It was held for the first time in 2016 and proved very
popular. 

Before the trip in 2017 it was really to hard to find any information on the exact date of
the parade. Only while already being in the country I finally was able to find a Facebook 
event about the parade with a confirmed date of 28th of October. The general pattern seems
to be that it is going to be held on the last Saturday before the actual celebrations 
(31th October - 2nd November). Many other events are generally also held this weekend all around
the country.

The route of most events in the city seems to be the same - starting at Estela de Luz next to
Chapultepec park, following along the Paseo de la Reforma, then turning right to Avenida Juarez,
passing by Bellas Artes and finishing at Zocalo square. It took 2-3 hours for the procession
to reach the destination.

The parade itself was visited by a few million of people, making it quite difficult to move around.
I recommend reserving a good spot along the Reforma avenue a couple of hours before the official start.

Beware of pickpocketing. I was really careful with protecting my camera, but in the end I was 
missing my wallet and phone. This made the rest of the trip quite difficult, because I also
forgot about the basic precaution of splitting bank cards into several places. They took all of
them at once. Anyway, the parade was great, as also the other days of visiting the altars all around the 
city, especially in San Antonio and Coyoacan.
